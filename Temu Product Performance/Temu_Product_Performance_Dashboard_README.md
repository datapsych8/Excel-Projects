## üß† Project Overview

The **Temu Product Performance Dashboard** is an interactive Excel-based business intelligence solution designed to analyze and visualize product performance across multiple categories on the **Temu platform**.  

It enables both **technical and non-technical stakeholders** to quickly understand:
- Which product categories perform best  
- The relationship between pricing, ratings, and sales  
- The share of top-performing products  
- How different subcategories contribute to overall performance  

üìä Built completely in **Excel** using:
- Pivot tables  
- DAX measures  
- Interactive slicers  
- KPIs and Treemap visualizations  

---

## üéØ Objectives

1. Identify **top-performing product categories and subcategories**.  
2. Analyze the **relationship between price bands, ratings, and sales**.  
3. Provide insights into **top-performing vs low-performing products**.  
4. Create a clean, professional, and **interactive dashboard** for business storytelling.  

---

## üìä Data Source

- Dataset: *Temu Product Dataset* (CSV/Excel format)  
- Fields include:
  - Product ID, Category, Subcategory  
  - Sales Volume  
  - Ratings  
  - Median Price  
  - Seller Flag (Top Seller, Normal, Low Sales)

## üßπ Data Preparation & Cleaning

Performed in **Excel Power Query**:

- Removed duplicates and irrelevant fields  
- Fixed inconsistent category names  
- Cleaned missing and outlier values  
- Standardized price and ratings columns  
- Created calculated columns for performance segmentation  

üìò Example of Calculated Columns:
```excel
=IF([@Sales_Volume]>AVERAGE(Sales_Volume),"Top Performer","Low Performer")
```

---

## üß© Data Modeling

- Data modeled using **Power Pivot**  
- Created relationships between:
  - Product Table  
  - Category Table  
  - Price Band Table  
- DAX Measures Created:
  - Total Sales Volume  
  - Total Products  
  - Median Price  
  - Average Ratings  
  - % of Top Performers  

üìò Example DAX Formula:
```DAX
Top_Performer% = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Products), Products[Performance] = "Top Performer"),
    COUNTROWS(Products),
    0
)
```

## üé® Dashboard Design

The dashboard follows a **storytelling layout**, guiding the viewer through insights step by step.  

### üîπ Layout Components:
| Section | Chart Type | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Top KPIs | Cards with Icons | Overview of key metrics |
| Chart 1 | Horizontal Bar Chart | Sales by Category |
| Chart 2 | Clustered Column Chart | Distribution of Performance |
| Chart 3 | Combo Chart | Relationship between Price & Sales |
| Chart 4 | Scatter Plot | Ratings vs Sales Volume |
| Chart 5 | Treemap | Subcategory Contribution |

### üîπ Slicers Added:
- **Price Tier** (Ultra Low ‚Üí Ultra High)  
- **Seller Flag** (Top Seller, Low Sales, Normal)

## üí° Key Insights

| Visualization | 2-Line Insight |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Sales by Category** | *Home & Kitchen dominates sales, contributing over a quarter of total volume. Jewelry & Accessories follows closely.* |
| **Performance by Category** | *Women's Clothing and Jewelry have the highest share of top performers.* |
| **Price vs Sales (Combo Chart)** | *Lower price bands (Ultra Low, Low) drive the highest total sales volume, showing affordability boosts performance.* |
| **Ratings vs Sales (Scatter)** | *Products with ratings above 4.0 tend to have disproportionately higher sales.* |
| **Treemap (Subcategories)** | *Office & School, Shoes, and Wellness categories make up the bulk of top-performing subcategories.* |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Challenges & Limitations

| Challenge | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| Treemap Automation | Initially planned to automate Treemap with dynamic DAX but later opted for manual creation for simplicity. |
| Data Volume | Large dataset caused Excel lag during pivot updates. |
| Visual Clarity | Balancing detailed charts with clean layout took multiple iterations. |
| KPI DAX Integration | Some DAX formulas required recalibration due to column naming inconsistencies. |

## üß≠ Lessons Learned

1. The importance of **data cleaning and column standardization** before modeling.  
2. How to apply **DAX and pivot calculations** effectively in Excel.  
3. Dashboard storytelling must be **visually intuitive** for mixed audiences.  
4. Using filters like **Top 10%** improved clarity and focus.  
5. Sometimes **manual tweaks** (like the treemap) are better than over-automation.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Microsoft Excel (Power Pivot & Power Query)** | Data transformation & modeling |
| **DAX** | Advanced metric calculation |
| **Excel Charts & Slicers** | Visualization & interactivity |
| **Conditional Formatting** | KPI visualization |
